Here is an example of a tunnel setup beetween Linux and Fortigate. It uses StrongSwan.

````
conn myconn
    type=tunnel
    left=[local_ip_address]
    leftsubnet=[local_subnet_to_be_accessed_through_tunnel]
    right=[remote_ip_address]
    rightsubnet=[remote_subnet_to_be_accessed_through_tunnel]
    keyexchange=ike
    ikelifetime=28800s
    ike=aes256-sha1-modp1536
    authby=secret
    keylife=1800s
    esp=aes256-sha1
    auto=start
````

This configures the forwarding policy. If you want to access the remote end of the tunnel from the gateway, set up a virtual interface and configure it with an address within the local_subnet.
